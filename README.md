# Code for "[Covariance-based Space Regularization for Few-shot Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01172)"

# Steps:
1. Prepare your data (all public datasets, CIFAR100, CUB200, MiniImageNet, datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/icoz69/CEC-CVPR2021).
2. Change the data root in the .sh file, you can also identify which GPU to use.
3. Run the model.

# Requirements:
1. PyTorch >= version 1.1 and torchvision
2. tqdm
3. sklearn
4. numpy
